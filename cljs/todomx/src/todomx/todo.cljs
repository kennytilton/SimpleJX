;;; FYI: every implementation I looked at stores all Todos as a single blob in
;;; localStorage. The TodoMVC spec does not require anything more, but it seems
;;; unrealistic. This implementation stores/updates each to-do individually. We
;;; also record 'completed' as a timestamp (not just a boolean), track a 'created'
;;; timestamp, and use a 'deleted' timestamp to support logical deletion.
;;; That is just how we would build any real world app (and storing the to-dos
;;; individually actually simplifies some of the code.)

    ;; the TodoMVC challenge has a requirement that routes "go thru the

    ;; functions for each subset. For fun we used dedicated cells:

    :items-completed (cF (p :completed (doall (filter td-completed (<mget me :items)))))

    ;; two DIVs want to hide if there are no to-dos, so we dedicate a cell
    ;; to that semantic. Yes, this could be a function, but then the Cell
    ;; calling that function would recompute unecessarily each time a to-do
    ;; was added or removed. In fact, the 'empty?' state changes only when
    ;; the count goes to or from zero, so we avoid recomputing two "hiddens"
    ;; unnecessarily when the count changes, say, from 2 to 3.
